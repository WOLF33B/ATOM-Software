A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE CREATOR (WOLF33B)

I created this software to be helpful to everyone, not to be greedy. Please use it freely to create content, build your business, or learn.

All I ask in return is respect and only respect:
1. Respect the Code: Please do not hack, tamper with, reverse engineer, or break the software. It is already free. Please do not try to create a clone of it.
2. Respect the Work: Please do not hide the origin of this work.
3. Respect the Creator: Please keep negative or destructive comments to yourself rather than shaming me in public.

I promise to never betray your trust by locking the core version of this software behind a paywall. Software with this license WILL be FREE and ALWAYS be FREE.

Enjoy using it!
